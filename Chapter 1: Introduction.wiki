== What is Salt? ==
Salt is a remote execution framework and configuration management system.
Written in Python and configured with YAML by default. This can be changed.

== High-Level Architecture ==
Hosts are minions.
Actions performed on them are called from the "master" server.
Client/Master model.
Salt runs as a daemon on both the master and minion servers.
Each minion has an ID and each ID must be unique.
Master sends or "publishes" events.
Minions receive or "subscribe" to events.
Publish and Subscribe, Pub-Sub.
Master has two ports for publish.
Default is 4505 and 4506.
Salt states are a way to manage configurations across all minions.
State has requirements listed.
Communication done via secure encrypted channel.
Minions do not have global secrets.

Declarative Vs. Imperative configuration management.
Imperative give Salt an ordered list of actions to perform.
Declarative give Salt a desired end state.
